2- create the slices file
  => this the slice file we have the 2 things 
        => 1- is the the name of the reducer
        =>2- reduceres are the functions or we say features that contains the logics of the funcions 
   => we use this reducers through useDispatch method
   => we use the useSelector to use the values like useState	
3- create a store 
     => in this store use the slices
4- wrap the app.js in provider and give the props is store={store}



information
in our project we use the features in slice files are using useSectors and usedispatch
the code flow in redux are :
=> first of all when i click on the buttons it actives the onclick function.
=> the onclick function contains the feature useing dispatch e.g. dispatch(incrementValue()).
=> then it go to the store for this feature but the feature is not available in store.
=> then it go to the slices file and get the specific feature.
